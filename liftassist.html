					<p class="subsection-title">OBJECTIVE</p>
					<p class="content">For the 2nd annual design competition at UCSD, our group had the opportunity to design a device that improves the quality-of-life of senior citizens. I collaborated with an interdisciplinary group of undergraduate students whom I meet through UCSD's Design for America. The overall goal of this competition is to find, design, and create a solution that will improve the lives of senior citizens. The competition is split into three different parts: Need finding, Prototyping, and Finalizing.</p>
					<p class="subsection-title">APPROACH</p>
					<p class="content">Due to the broad scope of the theme, we started by researching online and through research papers to give us a background on the current problem and existing solutions. We then went ahead in interviewing numerous seniors, care takers, and professionals in the field to give us an in-depth understanding of the problem and empathize with the seniors. Afterwards, we framed the problem we wanted to tackle and ideated until we decided on three ideas. We iterated through many prototypes until we finally created one that satisfied the needs of the seniors. </p>

			<!-- SECTION: DISCOVERY -->
			<h2 class="section-title">Discovery</h2>

			<p class="subsection-title">PROBLEM SPACE</p>
			<p class="content">A majority of seniors across the nation and in the world face problems dealing with communication, transportation, independence, and more. It was up to us students to research and find a certain problem space and ideate, design, and create a solution that would improve the quality of life of senior citizens.</p>

			<!-- Field Observations -->
			<p class="subsection-title">INTERVIEWS</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="listContent"><b>Interviews with Seniors</b><br>We interviewed and observed a wide array of seniors from different care homes. From our initial research, we discovered that the quality of life of seniors depended on the location, financial situation, and also if they were dependent or independent. We observed seniors in multiple occasions: UCSD Alumni Meet and Greet, La Costa Glen Retirement Community, and the American Canyon Care Home</li>
				<li class="listContent"><b>Interviews with Care Givers</b><br>To get the perspective of the ones taking care of the seniors, we interviewed caregivers from different facilities.</li>
				<li class="listContent"><b>Interview with Professionals</b><br>We were given the opportunity to interview a professional psychiatrist and a researcher that worked in the geriatrics ward. We were able to observe professional services when dealing with patients that were undergoing physical therapy.</li>

			<!-- SECTION: INTERPRETATION -->
			<h2 class="section-title">Interpretation</h2>
			<h2 class="section-title">Ideation</h2>
			<!-- Summary of main points -->
			<p class="subsection-title">MAIN POINTS</p>
			<p class="content">We wanted to tackle all of the problems that we observed so far. We found that Mobility, Health, and Independent Living were all tied down to if the seniors can stand up by themselves.</p>
			<!-- Question -->
			<p class="subsection-title">FRAMING OUR QUESTION</p>
			<p class="content">“How can we help seniors stand up from a sitting position?”</p>
			<!-- Ideation Proess -->
			<p class="subsection-title">IDEATION PROCESS</p>
			<p class="content">Our team had a few design sprint sessions focusing on finding a solution for our questions. Throughout this whole session, our group was able to come up with over 50 different ideas in helping seniors stand up from a sitting position. Each of us voted on ideas we thought were the most effective and efficient. After voting, we were able to narrow it down to three main ideas:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="listContent">An air-pump powered seat that would help seniors rise when trying to get up</li>
				<li class="listContent">Redesign the walker to be more senior-friendly when they want to stand up</li>
				<li class="listContent">A redesign of the chair cushion that would lift the seniors up while providing supports on the sides when they try getting up</li>
			</ol>

			<!-- SECTION: PROTOTYPING -->
			<h2 class="section-title">Prototyping & Testing</h2>
			<p class="subsection-title">FIRST PROTOTYPE</p>
			<p class="content">Our first prototype consisted of laser-cutting silicone glass. Usually most seniors use up a lot of energy trying to stand up while trying to grab onto something. We wanted to minimize this by having them rock off their chair. This would take advantage of the shape of the chair to have them rock off the bed or chair with minimal effort.</p>
			<p class="content"><b>The Problem:</b> This prototype was too unstable. When we tested with ourselves, it was too slippery and would often slide off the chair. We deemed it too dangerous to test with seniors.</p>
			<div class="your-class">

			    <img src="images/liftassist/prototype1-1.jpg">
			</div>

			<p class="subsection-title">SECOND PROTOTYPE</p>
			<p class="content">Since Idea #2 was too unstable, we decided to go with Idea #3 in building a chair cushion that would steadily lift the senior while standing. The sketches below details some of our initial ideas about the look and the mechanisms behind it. This prototype included handles on the side to give seniors a place to grab and hold on to for support when trying to stand up.</p>
			<p class="content">Our Sketches – These were the initial sketches we had when we tried visualizing the lift assist.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="subsection-title">THIRD PROTOTYPE</p>
			<p class="content">The picture below shows the final concept of the lift assist. I used Autodesk fusion 360 to design and render this 3-d model. Sadly, we forgot to take a picture of the physical version of this 3-d cad model but its overall function was very similar.</p>
			<img src="images/liftassist/liftassist-landing-img.png" class="singleImage">

			<p class="subsection-title">USER TESTING</p>
			<p class="content">We tested this prototype with several seniors prior to the final conclusion. Our group went over to La Costa Glen's retirement home to test our new seat. The picture below shows a senior testing our prototype as I ask some questions regarding the seat. Main takeaways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="listContent">Loved the concept - many seniors expressed the need of getting help standing up</li>
				<li class="listContent">Seniors found it difficult to put the seat back to fold the seat back to normal</li>
				<li class="listContent">Portability - might be too bulky to bring everywhere</li>
			</ol>

			<!-- SECTION: EVOLUTION AND CONCLUSION -->
			<h2 class="section-title">Evolution & Conclusion</h2>
			<p class="subsection-title">FINAL PRESENTATION</p>
			<p class="content">We presented our final solution to the whole La Costa Glen community, a panel of judges from UCSD’s design lab, and a few industry partners. The seniors and judges loved the overall concept but we weren't able to complete the final prototype on time. The object to my right is a semi-completed version of our final seat. </p>
			<img src="images/liftassist/liftassist-presentation.jpg" class="singleImage">
			<p class="subsection-title">REFLECTION</p>
			<p class="content">This was my very first design project that I was a part of. I've learned so much during this past year of working with seniors, designers, and engineers. Through this project, I've learned the importance of the need of cocreation and constant testing. One of the things we've failed to do well was testing after every iteration of prototypes. We needed the flow of constant feedback in order to improve our prototype during each iteration. I will keep these lessons in mind when working on future projects.</p>
			<p class="content">I would like thank my team, UCSD, and La Costa Glen for an amazing learning experience!</p>
